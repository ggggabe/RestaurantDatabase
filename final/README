This is just a preliminary submission to show that we have the database
and patterns, and a draft of the presentation. We were granted an
extension because Gabe was mugged Tuesday night and is dealing with
annoying things in the aftermath. The final submission will be from
Gabe's Sakai account. Also, note that we changed the schema a little
bit from our previous submissions.
