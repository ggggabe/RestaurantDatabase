The titles of the sql files explain what the queries do, and the results are in the
csv files of the same name. Plots are in the plots folder. Perhaps for the web interface,
we can have boxes where you can do the following:

    run the same exact queries in these files and display the results
    input a restaurant name and date and get its csm for that day
    input a restaurant and get its average tip, or v_factor, or yelp_factor, etc.

The first one requries no interaction; I don't know how much interaction is required.
If you have time you could make it so you can input restaurant names, etc, and substitute
the inputs into the queries I wrote, or modified versions of them, to let the user
retrieve specific information.
